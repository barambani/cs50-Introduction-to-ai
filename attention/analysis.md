## Layer 8, Head 11

This layer's head seems to have learned attention of each determiner to the word it refers to. In the first sentence below that would be the first `the` showing attention on `team` and the second on `season`. The second sentence is an even more evident example, as all the `the` and `an` determiners show correctly attention to `dog`, `cat`, `mouse` and `car`.

Example Sentences:
- In the past the team decided to [MASK] on the next season
- And the dog the ugly cat and the unsubordinated mouse started [MASK] an old abandoned car
